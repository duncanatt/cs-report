\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

This chapter presents an overview of the background literature and state-of-the-art in the field of \RV for distributed systems. 
%
We first give a brief synopsis of \RV, and define the terms introduced in the preceding chapter.
%
This is followed by an account of distributed systems that acquaints readers with the concepts used throughout this report.
%
Finally, a series of recent works is discussed, comparing and contrasting similarities and differences between them.
%
This exposition should reassert the current limitations in the area, and in doing so, underscore the novelty of our research contributions proposed in \cref{ch:introduction}.
