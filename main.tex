  \begin{abstract}
    
    A number of software systems today are built in terms of independently executing components that typically reside on different physical locations.
    %
    While these software organisations offer a number of advantages, including the use of replication to improve robustness and quality of service, they are hard to design and implement. 
    %
    Ascertaining their correctness, therefore, becomes a chief concern.
    %
    Traditional formal verification techniques, such as testing or model checking, tend to be applied with limited success in these scenarios due to a number of reasons.
    %
    Runtime verification may be employed as a lightweight and dynamic alternative that complements the aforementioned verification approaches.
